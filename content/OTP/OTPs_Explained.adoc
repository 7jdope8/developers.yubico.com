== OTPs Explained

A YubiKey OTP is a 44-character, one use, secure, 128-bit encrypted Public ID and
Password, near impossible to spoof. The OTP is comprised of two major parts:
the first 12 characters remain constant and represent the Public ID of the YubiKey
device itself.  The remaining 32 characters make up a unique passcode for each OTP 
generated.

The passcode is generated from a multitude of random sources, including 
counters for both YubiKey sessions and OTPs generated. When a YubiKey OTP is verified,
the session and OTP counter values are compared to last values submitted.
If the counters are less than the previously used values the OTP is rejected. 
Copying an OTP will not allow another user to spoof a YubiKey -- the counter value
will allow the validation server to know which OTPs have already been used.
