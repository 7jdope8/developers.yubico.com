== What is YubiKey OTP? ==
YubiKey abbr:OTP[One-Time Password] is a simple yet strong authentication mechanism that
is supported by all YubiKeys out of the box. YubiKey OTP can be used as the second
factor in a 2-factor authentication scheme or on its own, providing 1-factor
authentication.

The most common pattern is to use YubiKey OTP in combination with a username and password:

=== YubiCloud
https://www.yubico.com/products/services-software/yubicloud[YubiCloud] is the name of Yubico's web service for verifying OTPs. Before using YubiCloud, you need to get an API key from link:https://upgrade.yubico.com/getapikey/[here] -- it's quick, free and helps us preventing misuse of YubiCloud.

If you prefer to not use YubiCloud, you can instead link:/Software_Projects/YubiKey_OTP/YubiCloud_Validation_Servers[host a verification server] yourself.

=== Advantages
Apart from the general advantages of 2-factor authentication, YubiKey OTP has the following characteristics:

 - *No client software needed*. The OTP is just a string. If you can send a password, you can send an OTP.
 - *YubiKey ID embedded in OTP*. This allows for self-provisioning, as well as authenticating without a username.
 - *Easy to implement*. Using YubiCloud, supporting YubiKey OTP is not much harder than supporting regular passwords.


== Implementing
We provide two alternatives:

 * *link:Plugins.html[Integration plugins]* for software such as Wordpress, phpBB and PAM.
   This should be the easiest alternative if you are using supported software.
 * *link:Libraries[Libraries for programming languages]* used to create your own integration.

== Understanding
While not required, it can be interesting and useful to know how a YubiKey OTP is generated. This
is explained in link:OTPs_Explained.html[OTPs explained].
