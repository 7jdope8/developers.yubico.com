The Modified Hexadecimal encoding scheme was invented to cope with potential keyboard mapping ambiguities, namely the inconstant locations of keys between different keyboard layouts. YubiKey OTP uses this special data encoding format known as 'modhex' rather than normal hex encoding or base64 encoding. Modhex is similar to hex encoding but with a different encoding alphabet. The reason is to achieve a keyboard layout independent encoding.
