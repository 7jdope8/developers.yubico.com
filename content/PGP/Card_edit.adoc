= YubiKey NEO OpenPGP Applet configuration

[IMPORTANT]
====
Yubico has learned of a security issue with the OpenPGP Card applet project that is used in the YubiKey NEO. This vulnerability applies to you only if you are using OpenPGP, and you have the OpenPGP applet version 1.0.9 or earlier.

== Introduction

To configure the OpenPGP application on a YubiKey you can use GnuPG.

== Prerequisites

Make sure you have a recent YubiKey with firmware version 3.1.8 or
later; use "lsusb -v" to find out.

Make sure the device is in OTP/CCID or CCID mode, use the YubiKey
personalization tool "ykpersonalize -m82" to switch.

Check that your libccid version is 1.4.10 or later so that
/etc/libccid_Info.plist contains the YubiKey USB PID/VID.

Check that your PCSCD setup is working.  Use "pcsc_scan" to check for
card readers, it should show "Yubikey" somewhere in the output.

You need to use the GnuPG agent with scdaemon, and we recommend using
version 2.0.22 or later for full functionality.

To check the application version you may run, after inserting your YubiKey:

  $ gpg-connect-agent --hex "scd apdu 00 f1 00 00" /bye
  D[0000]  01 00 05 90 00                                     .....
  OK

Where "01 00 05" means version 1.0.5. (see security advisory above if version < 1.0.10)

Note that with the release of YubiKey 4, this number will always be
equal to the firmware version.

== YubiKey 4 touch

YubiKey 4 introduces a new _touch_ feature that allows to protect the
use of the private keys with an additional layer. When this
functionality is enabled, the result of a cryptographic operation
involving a private key (signature, decryption or authentication) is
released only if the correct user PIN is provided *and* the YubiKey
touch sensor is triggered. This request of user presence ensures that
no malware can issue commands to the YubiKey without the user
noticing. +
The YubiKey signals a request for a touch event by blinking for up to
15 seconds. If no touch is provided within this period, the operation
will fail.

There are three possible values for the touch parameter:

off:: touch is disabled;
on :: touch is enabled;
fix:: touch is enabled and can not be disabled unless a new private
  key is generated or imported.

The touch parameter can be individually set on each one of the three
private keys and requires the use of the admin PIN.

In order to activate this functionality, it is necessary to use a
custom bash script called `yubitouch.sh`. The script can be found

The following demonstrate setting all the parameters in the OpenPGP
applet on a YubiKey.

on the signature key:

  $ ./yubitouch.sh sig on
  All done!
