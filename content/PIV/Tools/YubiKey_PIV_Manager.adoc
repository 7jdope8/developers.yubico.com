== YubiKey PIV Manager
The link:/yubikey-piv-manager[YubiKey PIV Manager] enables you to configure a
PIV-enabled YubiKey through a graphical user interface. It builds upon the
yubico-piv-tool command line interface to expose its features in an easy to use
way, as well as adds some additional functionality that makes it useful in a
corporate environment.
