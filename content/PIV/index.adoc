== What is PIV? ==
abbr:OTP[Personal Identity Verification], or FIPS 201, is a US government standard. It enables RSA or ECC sign/encrypt operations using a private key stored on a smartcard (such as the YubiKey NEO), through common interfaces like PKCS#11.

The most common pattern is to use YubiKey OTP in combination with a username and password:
