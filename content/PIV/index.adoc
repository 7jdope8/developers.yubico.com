== What is PIV? ==
abbr:PIV[Personal Identity Verification], or FIPS 201, is a US government standard. It enables RSA or ECC sign/encrypt operations using a private key stored on a smartcard (such as the YubiKey NEO), through common interfaces like PKCS#11.

PIV is primarily used for non-web applications.


=== Advantages
PIV has the following advantages:

 - *Built-in support*. Windows supports PIV out of the box.
 - *United States government standard*.
 - *Flexible*. PIV is a crypto toolbox that can be used to perform all common operations.
