== Attestation and Metadata
Upon registration, a device gives the server its attestation certificate.
This certificate can be (optionally) used to verify the
authenticity of the device. For example, a banking site might wish users to be
able to provide their own U2F devices for two-factor authentication, but only
wishes to allow devices of certain approved vendors. For other sites it might
be more about being able to provide some useful device information to the user,
when listing his or her registered devices.

It's up to each U2F device vendor to decide what type of information goes into
the attestation certificates, and how the authenticity of a certificate is
validated. In Yubico's case, all our attestation certificates are signed by the
root CA available link:/u2f/yubico-u2f-ca-certs.txt[here].

The attestation certificates are often small, and do not contain much
information about the device itself. For this reason we use a metadata format
which allows additional information about the device and vendor to be
associated with the certificate, providing device names, product images, etc.
Yubico provides such metadata about our devices
link:/u2f/yubico-metadata.json[here]. Several of our
link:/Software_Projects/FIDO_U2F/U2F_Server_Libraries/[U2F server libraries]
are capable of reading this format.
