== Servers
While it's quite easy to implement support for U2F by using a
link:/U2F/Libraries/Using_a_library.html[server library], it is sometimes
desirable to keep the U2F related logic outside of your application, making as
few modifications as possible to the application itself. For this reason we
have developed a U2F server, as well as a REST style API that we call U2FVAL.
The server provides U2F registration and authentication, as well as storage of
registration data, and provides the client with metadata about the devices
uses. This enables existing applications to enable multi-device U2F support
without needing to modify any existing database tables.

To get started with U2FVAL, check out our standalone link:/u2fval/[server], and
the link:U2FVAL_REST_API.html[REST API]. We also provide a number of connector
libraries, which make using the REST API even easier. You'll find them
link:/Software_Projects/FIDO_U2F/U2FVAL_Connector_Libraries/[here].
