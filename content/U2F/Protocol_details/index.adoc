== Protocol details
This section explains how U2F works under the hood. Nothing in here is required to use a U2F library; the intention is rather to make it easier to implement your own library and satisfy your curiosity.

=== Specification

==== Core
[horizontal]
link:fido-u2f-overview-v1.0.pdf[Architectual Overview]:: Describes the various design considerations which go into the protocol in detail and describes the user flows in detail. It describes the layering and intention of each of the detailed protocol documents. It describes the various privacy considerations in the protocol design through the document and summarizes these at the end.
link:fido-u2f-javascript-api-v1.0.pdf[JavaScript API]:: Describes the client side API in the web browser for accessing U2F capabilities. An online service or website can levearge U2F by using this API on the client side and pairing it with a server which can verify U2F messages on the server side. (Later specifications will describe APIs in non-browser contexts).
link:fido-u2f-raw-message-formats-v1.0.pdf[Raw Message Formats]:: Describes the binary format of request messages which go from the FIDO U2F server to the FIDO U2F token and the binary format of the response messages from the token to the server. These messages are encoded by the browser (FIDO client) for communication over a particular transport (such as USB) to the cryptographic core of the token which performs key generation and signing. A header file with standard values is also specified.
    link:fido-u2f-u2f.h-v1.0[Message Format Headers]::: A C header file defining the message formats.
link:fido-appid-and-facets.pdf[AppID and Facet Specification]:: Defines the scope of user credentials and how a trusted computing base which supports application isolation may make access control decisions about which keys can be used by which applications and web origins.
link:fido-glossary-v1.0.pdf[Technical Glossary]:: Defines the technical terms and phrases used in FIDO Alliance specifications and documents.

==== Transports
[horizontal]
link:fido-u2f-HID-protocol-v1.0.pdf[HID Protocol]:: Describes how the browser (FIDO client) frames the binary raw messages coming from the javascript API for transport over USB-HID to a U2F token. The binary raw messages are described in the 'FIDO U2F Raw Message Formats' document. A header file with standard values is also specified. [Later specifications will specify how the javascript APIs frames raw messages over other (non-USB) transports].
    link:fido-u2f-u2f.h-v1.0[Message Format Headers]::: A C header file defining the HID protocol.

==== Other
[horizontal]
link:fido-u2f-implementation-considerations-v1.0.pdf[Implementation considerations]:: Describes the client side API in the web browser for accessing U2F capabilities. An online service or website can levearge U2F by using this API on the client side and pairing it with a server which can verify U2F messages on the server side. (Later specifications will describe APIs in non-browser contexts).
link:fido-security-ref-v1.0[Security Reference]:: Provides an analysis of FIDO security based on detailed analysis of security threats pertinent to the FIDO protocols based on its goals, assumptions, and inherent security measures.
