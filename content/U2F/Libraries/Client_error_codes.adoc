== Client error codes
These are the error codes that can be returned by a U2F client:

1 - OTHER_ERROR::
	An error otherwise not enumerated here.
	
2 - BAD_REQUEST::
	One of the following reasons:
	* The visited URL doesn't match the App ID.
	* The App ID does not conform with link:../App_ID.adoc[the rules for App ID's].
	* The U2F API is called with bad parameters (e.g. calling `u2f.register` with the parameters in the wrong order).
	
3 - CONFIGURATION_UNSUPPORTED::
	Client configuration is not supported.

4 - DEVICE_INELIGIBLE::
	The presented device is not eligible for this request. For a registration request this may mean that the token is already registered, and for a sign request it may mean that the token does not know the presented key handle.
	
5 - TIMEOUT::
	Timeout reached before request could be satisfied.
