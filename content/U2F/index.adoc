=== What is U2F? ===
+++<abbr title="Universal 2nd Factor">U2F</abbr>+++ is a new, open 2-factor 
authentication standard that enables keychain tokens, mobile phones and other 
devices to securely access any
number of web-based services – instantly and with no drivers or client software
needed. The U2F specifications were initially developed by Google, with
contribution from Yubico and NXP, and are today hosted by the
link:https://fidoalliance.org[FIDO Alliance].

=== Adding client support ===


=== Adding server support ===
We provide three alternatives:

 * *link:foo[Plugins for Content Management Systems]* (CMS), such as Wordpress
   and Joomla. This should be the easiest alternative if you are using a supported CMS.
 * *Standalone validation server* that your server queries using a simple REST API.
   You can either use link:foo[Yubico's validation server cloud] or 
   link:foo[host a validation server yourself].
 * *link:foo[Libraries for programming languages]*. With these, you have the 
   flexibility/burden to setup HTTP endpoints for U2F and implement storage of U2F
   yourself.
