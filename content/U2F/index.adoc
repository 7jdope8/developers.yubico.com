== What is U2F? ==
abbr:U2F[Universal 2nd Factor] is an open 2-factor 
authentication standard that enables keychain devices, mobile phones and other 
devices to securely access any
number of web-based services -- instantly and with no drivers or client software
needed. The link:/U2F/Protocol_details[U2F protocol] were initially developed by Google, with
contributions from Yubico and NXP, and are today hosted by the
link:https://fidoalliance.org[FIDO Alliance].

=== Advantages ===
Apart from the general advantages of 2-factor authentication, U2F has the following characteristics:

 - *Phishing protection*.
 - *User experience*. No codes to enter and no drivers to install.
 - *No shared secrets*. Unlike for example OATH, U2F uses public key cryptography and uses no shared secrets.
 - *Anonymous*. New public keys are minted for each site. 
 - *Universal*. Devices can be of different types (hardware token, fingerprint reader, software token, etc.) and
   communicate using different transports (USB,
   link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_field_communication[NFC],
   link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth_low_energy[Bluetooth]).
 - *Open standard*.
 - *Backed by industry leaders*. Google, Bank of America and https://fidoalliance.org/membership/members[150 other companies].

This diagram explains the basic process flow of U2F:

msc {

   # Entities
   d [label = "Device"], b [label="Browser"], s [label="Server"];

   # Arcs
   |||;
   b -> s [label = "username and password"];
   s rbox s [label="verify password"];
   s rbox s [label="generate challenge"];
   s -> b [label = "challenge"];
   b => d [label = "challenge"];
   d rbox d [label="user touches button"];
   d >> b [label = "response"];
   b -> s [label = "response"];
   s rbox s [label="verify response"];
}

== Implementing ==
We provide three alternatives:

 * *link:Plugins.html[Plugins for Content Management Systems]* (CMS), such as Wordpress
   and Django. This is the easiest alternative if you are using a supported CMS.
 * *link:Servers[Standalone validation server]* that your server can query using a simple REST API.
   This is ideal if you want to make as few changes as possible to your existing code and database.
 * *link:Libraries[Libraries for programming languages]*. With these, you have the 
   flexibility/burden to store and access U2F artifacts yourself.
   This is ideal if you don't want to deploy a standalone validation server.
