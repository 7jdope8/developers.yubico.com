== What is U2F? ==
+++<abbr title="Universal 2nd Factor">U2F</abbr>+++ is a new, open 2-factor 
authentication standard that enables keychain tokens, mobile phones and other 
devices to securely access any
number of web-based services â€“ instantly and with no drivers or client software
needed. The U2F specifications were initially developed by Google, with
contribution from Yubico and NXP, and are today hosted by the
link:https://fidoalliance.org[FIDO Alliance].

This is a sequence diagram explains a how U2F works:

++++
<div class="diagram">
participant Token
participant Browser
Browser->Server: username and\npassword
Note over Server: verify username\nand password
Note over Server: generate U2F\nchallenge
Server->Browser: challenge (e.g. embedded\nin a HTML page)
Browser->Token: challenge
Note over Token: user touches\nbutton
Token-->Browser: response
Browser-->Server: response
Note over Server: verify response
</div>

== Implementing ==
We provide three alternatives:

 * *link:Libraries.html[Plugins for Content Management Systems]* (CMS), such as Wordpress
   and Joomla. This should be the easiest alternative if you are using a supported CMS.
 * *Standalone validation server* that your server queries using a simple REST API.
   You can either use link:foo[Yubico's validation server cloud] or 
   link:foo[host a validation server yourself]. This is arguably easier than using a library.
 * *link:Libraries.html[Libraries for programming languages]*. With these, you have the 
   flexibility/burden to setup HTTP endpoints for U2F and implement storage of U2F
   yourself.
