== Configure the Primary YubiHSM 2 Device

The YubiHSM Setup program is used to perform the initial configuration of the primary YubiHSM 2 device so that the necessary key material is generated on it:

* One wrap key to be split as described in "Key Splitting and Key Custodians" in https://developers.yubico.com/YubiHSM2/Usage_Guides/YubiHSM_2_Windows_Deployment_Guide/Prerequisites_and_Preparations.adoc[Prerequisites and Preparations].
* One application authentication key for authenticating to the YubiHSM 2 through the KSP. This allows the KSP to perform operations in the YubiHSM 2.

_Note: This initial configuration replaces the default authentication key with a new one, which will only be operable in the same domain as the asymmetric key. The link:../../Concepts/Domain.adoc[domain concept] that is used to compartmentalize the YubiHSM 2 determines this behavior._

TIP: For test purposes you can set the `yubihsm-setup -d` flag to keep the default authentication-key with the administrative privileges; this will allow you to delete keys on the YubiHSM 2 for test purposes only. For production purposes, however, the `yubihsm-setup` command must be executed without the `-d` flag to ensure that the factory preset authentication key is properly deleted from the YubiHSM 2 device._

* One audit key for accessing the internal audit log of the device and resetting the audit log. The audit log retains information about the last 62 operations. It is also used to purge the log if needed. Depending on your local requirements, you may not need to create an audit key. If you are unsure of your requirements, we suggest you create an audit key.

The authentication key and the audit key are exported under wrap to a file in the current working directory on the machine where the YubiHSM Setup program is installed.

TIP: The YubiHSM Setup tool has a help argument that you can call to learn more about its usage.


=== Overview of Procedure

The configuration steps to be performed  are set out briefly below. These steps are described in detail in the subsequent "Procedure: Configuring Primary YubiHSM 2."

0. Insert the primary factory preset YubiHSM 2 device into the air-gapped system.

1. Set up communication between the YubiHSM 2 tools and the device.

2. Start the configuration process.

3. Authenticate to the YubiHSM 2 device.

4. Specify whether you need to add RSA decryption. If you plan to use your YubiHSM 2 exclusively with an application that only needs signing capabilities, RSA decryption is not required. Active Directory Certificate Services (ADCS), for example, does not require RSA decryption. However, if you are planning on using the same YubiHSM 2 device for something that requires the capability to decrypt RSA, then you do need RSA decryption. This is the case for Microsoft SQL Server Always Encrypted, for example.

5. Enter the name of the domain in which you need the application authentication key and audit key to be available.

6. Create the *wrap key*.

7. Split the wrap key into shares and specify the number of shares required to regenerate the wrap key.

8. Create the *application authentication key* and its password. The password to the authentication key must be at least eight (8) characters.

9. Create the *audit key*.

=== Procedure: Configuring Primary YubiHSM 2

*Step 1*: Enable communication with the YubiHSM 2 device by running the YubiHSM Connector on the system where the device is inserted. If the YubiHSM Connector is running on a host machine to which the YubiHSM 2 is physically connected, the Connector should be started in networked mode. For example, if the host IP address is 192.168.100.252, the Connector should be started on the host machine with the following command:

`$ yubihsm-connector -l 192.168.100.252:12345`

In this scenario, you can verify that the Connector is running properly by typing the following URL into your web browser:

`http://192.168.100.252:12345/connector/status`

The output in the web browser should be similar to:

....
status=OK
serial=*
version=1.0.0
pid=*
address=192.168.100.252
port=12345
....

*Step 2*: In the Command Prompt, navigate to a directory for which you have write access and run the YubiHSM Setup with the argument `ksp`.

....
        $ yubihsm-setup ksp
....

If the application calling it is installed on a machine other than the YubiHSM Connector, the `connector` flag needs to specify the Connector URL. For example:

....
$ yubihsm-setup --connector http://192.168.100.252:12345 ksp
....

*Step 3*: To start the YubiHSM Setup process, type the default authentication key password `password`. A message is displayed, confirming that the default authentication key was used and that you are authenticated to the device:

`Using authentication key 0x0001`

Object IDs are displayed in the YubiHSM Setup Tool using hexadecimal numbers. In this case the default authentication key is ID `1` (or `0x0001` in hexadecimal format).

*Step 4*: You are prompted to add RSA decryption capabilities. Enter `y` or `n`.

TIP: If you are unsure what selection to make, select no (`n`).

*Step 5*: You are prompted for the domain(s) you need the keys to be available in. Unless you have a requirement to assign more than one domain, enter a number between 1 and 16. In this guide, we assume that domain 1 was entered. The confirmation will look like one of the following:

....
got domains [
One
]
....

or

....
Using domains:
One
Enter wrap keyID (0 to choose automatically):
....

*Step 6*: You are prompted to create a wrap key and enter its ID. Do one of the following:

* To manually assign a wrap key ID, type a number for the ID. As object ID `1` is already in use by the default application authentication key, we recommend assigning ID `2` to the wrap key.
* To allow the system to generate a wrap key ID automatically, type `0`.

In both cases, a confirmation message like the following is displayed:

`Stored wrap key with ID 0x0002 on the device`

*Step 7*: You are prompted to configure splitting the wrap key among a number of key custodians. For this example, we will assume that the wrap key is split into three shares, of which at least two shares must be present in order to regenerate the key.

_Note: See "Key Splitting and Key Custodians" in https://developers.yubico.com/YubiHSM2/Usage_Guides/YubiHSM_2_Windows_Deployment_Guide/Prerequisites_and_Preparations.adoc[Prerequisites and Preparations] for key custodian instructions._

TIP: For test purposes, such as in a lab scenario where wrap key sharing is not crucial, it is not necessary to specify that the wrap key should be shared between key custodians. Instead, you can use a single key. To do this, when configuring the device using YubiHSM Setup, indicate the number of shares to be `1` and the privacy threshold to also be `1`.

When prompted, do the following:

a) Enter the number of shares. In this example, enter `3`.

b) Enter the privacy threshold. In this example, enter `2`.

*Step 8*: When the relevant prompt is displayed, each of the three wrap key custodians should take their turn in front of the screen to record their share. A warning notice appears advising you/them  that the shares are not stored anywhere.

The following is an example of a share presented on the screen:

....
2-1-WWmTQj5PHGJQ4H9Y2ouURm8m75QkDOeYzFzOX1VyMpAOeF3YKYZyA…
Have you recorded the key share? (y/n)
....

[IMPORTANT]
============
Each custodian must record the whole string presented, including the prefix (in this example, `2-1-`) which indicates the number of shares required to regenerate the key (the privacy threshold) and the number identifying where in the sequence the share was created.
============

a) To start having the custodians record the key shares, press **Enter**.

b) The first custodian records his or her share and confirms that the share was recorded by pressing `y`.  The screen buffer is cleared before the next share is presented.

c) The next custodian records the key share for the second share, confirms it, and so on.

*Step 9*: You are prompted to create an **application authentication key**. Since object IDs `1` and `2` are already in use by the default authentication key and the wrap key respectively, the example in this guide assumes that the application authentication key to be created gets ID `3`. Do one of the following:

* To manually assign an application authentication key ID, type `3`.
* To allow the system to generate a wrap key ID automatically, type `0`.

*Step 10*: Create a password for the application authentication key. Be sure to store the password of the application authentication key so that it cannot be compromised. You will need this information later to configure the YubiHSM KSP DLL. The password should be at least eight (8) characters. Enter the application authentication key password. A confirmation message like the following appears:

....
Stored application authentication key with ID 0x0003 on the device
Saved wrapped application authentication key to 0x0003.yhw
....

The wrapped application authentication key (in this example, `0x0003.yhw`) is saved to the current working directory. Although the keys are encrypted using the wrap key, we recommend that you do not store keys - even under wrap - on network-accessible or any storage media that could be compromised. However, if you are making the backup (and you should), leave the `*.yhw-file` with the wrapped authentication key where it was saved for now.

*Step 11*: Decide whether to create an **audit authentication key**. To log into the YubiHSM 2 with this authentication key, both the key ID and the password will be needed.

a) When prompted to create an audit key, type `y`.

b) When prompted, assign a key ID to the audit key. Make a note of the ID you enter (for example, key ID `4`).

c) When prompted, enter the audit key password. Store this password so that it cannot be compromised.

The audit key is exported under wrap to the current working directory. Using our example of key ID `4`, the file will be named `0x0004.yhw`.

*Step 12*: The setup tool (in default mode) finishes by letting you know that the previous authentication key has been deleted.

....
Previous authentication key 0x0001 deleted
All done
....

The YubiHSM Setup application exits. The YubiHSM 2 device is equipped with the symmetric keys for wrap, audit, and application authentication.
