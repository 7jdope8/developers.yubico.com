== Verify the YubiHSM 2 Setup

You can verify the results of the YubiHSM Setup program by using the YubiHSM Shell program, and logging in using the application authentication key. To verify the YubiHSM 2 setup:

*Step 1*: In your Command Prompt, run the following command:

`$ yubihsm-shell`

If the YubiHSM Connector is running on a host machine to which the YubiHSM 2 is physically connected, the YubiHSM Shell program should be started in networked mode. For example, if the host server IP-address is 192.168.100.252, the YubiHSM Shell program should be started with the following command at the VM:

`$ yubihsm-shell â€“-connector http://192.168.100.252:12345`

*Step 2*: To connect to the YubiHSM 2, at the yubihsm prompt, type `connect`. A message verifying that you have a successful connection is displayed.

*Step 3*: To open a session with the YubiHSM 2, type `session open 3`.

*Step 4*: Type in the password for the application authentication key. You will receive a confirmation message that session 0 has been set up successfully.

*Step 5*: You now have an administrative connection to the YubiHSM 2 and can list the objects available. To list the objects, type list objects 0. Your results should be similar to the following:

....
Found 3 object(s)
id: 0x0002, type: wrap-key, sequence: 0
id: 0x0003, type: authentication-key, sequence: 0
id: 0x0004, type: authentication-key, sequence: 0
....

As you can see by looking at their IDs, these objects correspond to the wrap key, the
application authentication key and the audit key that were just created.

*Step 6* To obtain more information about any one of the objects, for example, the application authentication key (object ID 3), including its capabilities, type the following command:

`yubihsm> get objectinfo 0 3 authentication-key`

The response you receive should look similar to the following:

....
id: 0x0003, type: authentication-key, algorithm:
aes128-yubico-authentication, label: "Application auth key", length: 40, domains: 1, sequence: 0, origin: imported, capabilities: exportable-under-wrap:generate-asymmetric-key:
sign-attestation-certificate:sign-pkcs:sign-pss:sign-ecdsa,
delegated_capabilities:exportable-under-wrap: generate-asymmetric-key:sign-attestation-certificate:sign-pkcs:
sign-pss:sign-ecdsa
....

This indicates that YubiHSM 2 has now been configured to:

* Generate asymmetric objects
* Compute signatures using RSA-PKCS1v1.5
* Compute signatures using RSA-PSS
* Export other objects under wrap
* Import wrapped objects
* Mark an object as exportable under wrap

In addition, this object (the application authentication key, object ID 3) also has
delegated capabilities. Delegated capabilities define the set of capabilities that can be set or
"bestowed" onto other objects that it creates.

*Step 7*: To exit, type quit.
