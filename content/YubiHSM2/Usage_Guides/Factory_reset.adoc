== Resetting device to factory settings

Before deploying the YubiHSM 2 in a production environment, it may be necessary to reset the device to its factory settings, for instance in order to facilitate tests or training. 

A reset destroys any objects stored on the device that are not factory-installed.

=== Physical reset

The device can be physically reset to its factory settings. To do this, while inserting the device into a USB port, press the metal rim
as you insert the device and continue to press the rim for a minimum of 10 seconds.

=== Reset using YubiHSM 2 Shell
