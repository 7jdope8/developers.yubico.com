Set a device-global option.

== Description

Set device-global options that affect general behavior. Each invocation
of this command sets a single option, which is represented as a
TAG-LENGTH-VALUE (TLV).

== Shell example

Turn off audit logging for hmac data (command 53) and hmac verify (command 5c):

  yubihsm> put option 0 command_audit 53005c00

== Protocol details

=== Command

|T~c~ = 0x4f
|L~c~ = 3 + L~o~
|V~c~ = T~O~
|===============

T~o~ := The TLV encoding of the selected option

L~o~ := The option-specific length in bytes

The options currently supported are the following:

TAG is 1 byte

LENGTH is 2 bytes, Big Endian

VALUE is L~o~ bytes, Big Endian

Tags:

|Force audit | 0x01
|Command audit | 0x03
|===

Values:
|===
|OFF | 0x00 | Disabled
|ON  | 0x01 | Enabled
|FIX | 0x02 | Enabled, not possible to turn off
|===

There is two supported options, "Force audit" and "Command audit".
With "Force audit" set the device will refuse operations when the audit log is
full until the log has been read out. It takes a 1 byte value option.
"Command audit" can be used to toggle whether a specific command should be
logged, this takes tuples of command and option value.

=== Response

|===========
|T~r~ = 0xcf
|L~r~ = 0
|V~r~ = Ã˜
