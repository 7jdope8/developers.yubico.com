== Yhwrap

Yhwrap is a tool that allows to create importable objects offline. This is useful when bootstrapping secrets for example on an air-gapped computer.

The tool requires an unencrypted Wrapkey in binary format and uses that to wrap objects with given Type, Algorithm, ID, Capabilities and where applicable Delegated Capabilities.

For the resulting Object to be successfully imported on a YubiHSM 2, the Wrapkey used by `yhwrap` must already be present on the device.

Currently not all Object Types are supported. Refer to link:../../Releases/Known_issues.adoc[Known Issues and Limitations] for more information.
