== Libyubihsm

Libyubihsm is the C library used to communicate natively with a YubiHSM 2. It implements and exposes convenience functions for all the commands supported by the device. It also allows to send unformatted "raw" messages over an established session or in plain-text.

The library is used by link:../yubihsm-shell[yubihsm-shell], the link:../PKCS_11[PKCS#11] module and the link:../KSP[KSP].

Documentation of the library API can be found as comments within the header file (`yubihsm.h`) in the link:../../Releases[SDK], or as a pre-built link:../../Releases[Doxygen bundle].
