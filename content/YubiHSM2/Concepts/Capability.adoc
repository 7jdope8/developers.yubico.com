== Capability

A Capability is an attribute that can be given to an link:Object.adoc[Object] allowing specific operations to be performed on or with it. Commands like digital signature generation and data decryption require (and check) for a predetermined set of Capabilities to be present on an Object. Further below is the list of existing Capabilities.

It is important to know that there are no restrictions on which Capabilities can be set on an Object. Specifically, this means that it is possible to assign meaningless Capabilities to Objects that will never be able to use them, for example it is possible to have an Asymmetric Object with the capability `hmac_verify`. Such a Capability only makes sense for Hmackey Objects, but the device will allow defining a superset.
Lack of Capabilities required for a specific operation will cause a command requiring that Capability to fail.

=== Delegated Capabilities

Every Object stored on the device has an associated set of Capabilities. There is a second set of so-called Delegated Capabilities that only Authkeys and Wrapkeys have. This is used to capture the indirection that Authkeys and Wrapkeys can be used as a means of storing more Objects on a device. In both cases Delegated Capabilities are used as a filter.

For Authkeys, Delegated Capabilities define the set of Capabilities that can be set or "bestowed" onto an Object created by the Authkey. Any operation attempting to create Objects with a Capability outside of this set will fail.

For Wrapkeys, Delegated Capabilities define the set of Capabilities that an Object can have when imported or exported using the Wrapkey. A larger set of Capabilities will cause the import operation to fail.

== Protocol details

A Set of Capabilities is an 8-byte value. Each capability is identified by a specific bit, as shown in the `Hex Mask` column below.
