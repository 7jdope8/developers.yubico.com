== Backup and Restore

=== Introduction

The YubiHSM 2 supports encrypted export and import of objects using a symmetric AES-CCM based scheme.

=== Backup using yubihsm-shell

Make sure you have a Wrapkey with the Capabilities `export_wrapped`, `import_wrapped` and applicable Delegated Capabilities set:

[source, bash]
----
$ yubihsm-shell -a get-random --count=32 --out=wrap.key
...
$ yubihsm-shell -a put-wrapkey -c export_wrapped,import_wrapped --delegated=asymmetric_sign_pkcs,asymmetric_decrypt_pkcs,export_under_wrap --in=wrap.key
...
Stored Wrap key 0xd581
----

When this Wrapkey is present, any Object in the same Domain and with the Capability `export_under_wrap` and Capabilities matching the Wrapkey's Delegated Capabilities can be exported:

[source, bash]
----
$ yubihsm-shell -a generate-asymmetric -A rsa2048 -c export_under_wrap,asymmetric_sign_pkcs,asymmetric_decrypt_pkcs
...
Generated Asymmetric key 0x6e77
$ yubihsm-shell -a get-wrapped --wrap-id=0x6e77 --object-id=0xd581 -t asymmetric --out=key_6e77.yhw
...
----

You now have an encrypted backup of the Asymmetric Object 0x6e77 in the file key_6e77.yhw. *The file wrap.key here contains the cleartext version of the Wrapkey loaded into your YubiHSM and should be considered sensitive*.

=== Backup using yubihsm-setup

The tool yubihsm-setup can be used to backup all exportable objects at once:

[source, bash]
----
$ yubihsm-setup dump
Enter the wrapping key ID to use for exporting objects: 0xd581
...
Successfully exported object Asymmetric with ID 0x6e77 to ./0x6e77.yhw
All done
----

=== Restore using yubihsm-shell

Considering a fresh device where you want to restore the previously backed up key 0x6e77

[source, bash]
----
$ yubihsm-shell -a put-wrapkey -A aes256-ccm-wrap -c export_wrapped,import_wrapped --delegated=asymmetric_sign_pkcs,asymmetric_decrypt_pkcs,export_under_wrap --in=wrap.key -i 0xd581
...
Stored Wrap key 0xd581
$ yubihsm-shell -a put-wrapped -i 0xd581 --in=key_6e77.yhw
...
Object imported as 0x6e77 of type asymmetric
----

== Backup and Restore of Keys Managed via YubiHSM Key Storage Provider

ADCS does not set the `NCRYPT_ALLOW_EXPORT_FLAG` when generating a key neither through the setup UI, nor the `Install-ADCSCertificationAuthority` PowerShell module.  When creating an ADCS root CA key via the YubiHSM 2, we add the `export_under_wrapÂ´ Capability by default, so that backup and restore functionality is available through the following manual process:

=== Identify Your Private Key Container Name

Open an elevated command prompt/shell.

Use the certutil command:

[source, powershell]
----
PS1> certutil -store My
----

to view the currently installed certificates in the Local Machine "My" store.

Find the target certificate in the list.

Find the `Key Container` property of the target certificate.  The Provider property should be equal to `YubiHSM Key Storage Provider`.

Record the `Cert Hash` property to identify the certificate.

=== Backup the Target Certificate

Using any available means (certmgr.msc, PowerShell, certutil), export the target certificate, but without the private key in DER format. The YubiHSM 2 does not provide a mechanism for returning the raw private key to Windows, so generating a PKCS#12 container is not currently possible. For example:

[source, powershell]
----
PS1> certutil -split -store My <Cert Hash>
----

will export the certificate in .crt format to a file named `<Cert Hash>.crt`.

=== Backup the Target Private Key

Using the instructions for exporting a private key under wrap via `yubihsm-shell` (see above), export the target private key with the `label` property equal to the `Key Container` property.
The Authkey that performs this operation must have the `export_wrapped` capability.

=== Restore the Target Private Key

Using the instructions for importing a private key under wrap via `yubihsm-shell` (see above), import the target private key file to your backup YubiHSM 2. The Authkey that performs this operation must have the `import_wrapped` capability.

The imported key object should have the same `label` property as the original object.

=== Restore the target certificate

Move the target certificate file generated above to the target machine.

Import the certificate to the LocalMachine "My" store via your favorite method. At this point, the certificate will not have an associated private key.  Use the `-repairstore` functionality of `certutil` to re-associate the certificate to the private key.
Make sure that the target private key is visible via the YubiHSM KSP, using

[source, powershell]
----
PS1> certutil -key -csp "YubiHSM Key Storage Provider"
----

This command will list all private keys (and their corresponding container names -- which are equal to the label property in the YubiHSM 2 visible to the current Authkey).

Open an elevated prompt and execute the command:

[source, powershell]
----
PS1> certutil -repairstore MY <Cert Hash>
----

Repeat the steps under Identify Your Private Key Container Name to verify that the certificate has been associated with the YubiHSM Key Storage Provider and has the correct `Key Container` property value.
