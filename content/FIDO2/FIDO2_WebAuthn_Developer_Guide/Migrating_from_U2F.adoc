== Migrating From U2F
If you have users who have already registered U2F credentials with the U2F API, there is an extra step you need to take to make those existing credentials work in WebAuthn so your users do not have to re-register their authenticators.

The reason for this is that the U2F AppID and the WebAuthn Relying Party (RP) ID are slightly different. This does not matter for new registrations because the authenticator identifies the Relying Party by a hash of that ID, but if you try to use a U2F credential in the WebAuthn API, those hashes will not match. The solution to this is to use the appid extension and pass the U2F AppId as a parameter. That way the client can try the U2F AppId if the authenticator does not recognize the WebAuthn RP ID, so you can upgrade your server to using WebAuthn without breaking your users’ existing credentials.

For example, say your users have previously created U2F credentials for the U2F AppId “https://accounts.example.com”, and the new version of your service uses WebAuthn with the RP ID “example.com”. In this case you would set the appid extension argument to “https://accounts.example.com”, so that your users’ authenticators can still recognize your service.

=== Transitional Period User Flow Considerations
While browsers are working towards supporting the WebAuthn AppID extension there are edge cases you should be aware of. Particularly when user signs up using U2F and then the online service migrates to WebAuthn.

Let the user have a YubiKey 5 Series or Security Key by Yubico and visit the online service with the Chrome browser. 

. They register the security key with your online service that currently uses U2F using Chrome and are happy to now have strong two-factor authentication.
.. The credential is made on the key using the U2F API and the AppID.
.. Your online service, the RP, stores the key handle.
. Your online service migrates to WebAuthn
. The user comes back using Chrome version 70+ to authenticate.
.. Your service sends the AppID extension in the WebAuthn get request
. The user logs in and life is good.

Let the user visit the online service with a different machine, say computer B, with a browser that supports WebAuthn but not the AppID extension.

. The user clicks login button
. The browser prompts for the security key
. The user inserts the security key
. The browser informs them that the key doesn’t look familiar, please try a different one.
. The user goes back to the machine with the browser that supports WebAuthn and the AppID extension (Chrome) and can login successfully.
. User is unhappy that they can’t login to the online service from computer B.
