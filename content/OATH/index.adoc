== What is OATH? ==
abbr:OATH[Initiative for Open Authentication] is an organization that specifies two open authentication standards: abbr:TOTP[Time-based One-time Password Algorithm] and abbr:HOTP[HMAC-based One-time Password Algorithm].

== TOTP
To authenticate using TOTP, the user enters a 6-8 digit code that changes every 30 seconds. It can look like this:

The code is generated using `HMAC(sharedSecret, timestamp)`, where timestamp changes every 30 seconds. The shared secret is often provisioned as a QR-code or preprogrammed into a hardware token.

 
=== Websites with TOTP support
The website https://twofactorauth.org[twofactorauth.org] lists common websites that supports TOTP.


== HOTP
HOTP works just like TOTP, except that an authentication counter is used instead of a timestamp. The advantage of this is that HOTP devices requires no clock.


== Use OATH with the YubiKey
When using OATH with a YubiKey NEO, the shared secrets are stored and processed in the YubiKey's secure element.
This has a two advantages over storing secrets on a phone:

Security:: The secrets always stays within the YubiKey. A phone can get stolen, sold, infected by malware, have its storage read by a connected computer, etc.

Accessibility:: You can display OATH codes on more than one phone or computer. If your phone runs out of battery, you can get a code using a friends phone or your computer.

A YubiKey can emit a HOTP code when its button is pressed. This is configured using link:/yubikey-personalization-gui[Yubikey Personalization GUI]. For TOTP you need an link:YubiKey_OATH_software.html[application that can read OATH codes from YubiKeys], since YubiKeys does not have an internal clock.

 
== YubiKey firmware
The OATH support in the YubiKey NEO is provided by the open source link:/ykneo-oath[ykneo-oath] applet.
