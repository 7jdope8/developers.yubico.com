== What is OATH? ==
abbr:OATH[Initiative for Open Authentication] is an organization that specifies two open authentication standards: abbr:TOTP[Time-based One-time Password Algorithm] and abbr:HOTP[HMAC-based One-time Password Algorithm].

== TOTP
To authenticate using TOTP, the user enters a 6-8 digit code that changes every 30 seconds. It can look like this:

The code is generated using `HMAC(sharedSecret, timestamp)`, where timestamp changes every 30 seconds. The shared secret is often provisioned as a QR-code or preprogrammed into a hardware token.


=== Properties
TOTP has the following advantages:

 - *Simple*. The concept is relatively simple.

 
=== Websites with TOTP support
The website https://twofactorauth.org[twofactorauth.org] lists common websites that supports TOTP.


=== Use TOTP with the YubiKey
Yubico Authenticator. Bla bla. 
 
 
=== YubiKey firmware
The OATH support in the YubiKey NEO is provided by the open source link:/ykneo-oath[ykneo-oath] applet.


== HOTP
HOTP works just like TOTP, except that an authentication counter is used instead of a timestamp. The advantage of this is that HOTP devices requires no clock.
