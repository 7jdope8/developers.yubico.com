This contains project documentation for each of our projects. The idea is to
pull content from GitHub, using a module. The README becomes the index page,
and the wiki pages become the Documents.
Ordering of projects is specified by the .order file.

Ordering of wiki pages in individual projects can be specified by an .order
file either in this repository or in the wiki repository of the project.
