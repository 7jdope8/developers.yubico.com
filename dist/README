This is the root of the content. Any directories here will become top level
sections on developers.yubico.com. The index page here will be displayed at the
root of the site.

Directory names are case-sensitive, but you should use underscores (_) instead
of spaces.

The file `.conf.json` contains the ordering of the Sections, as they will appear in
the main menu. Items which don't appear in .conf.json are shown in alphabetical
order after any items which are contained in .conf.json
